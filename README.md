*Graphematics
Graphematics is a Python-based application developed using the Tkinter library. It serves as an educational tool for studying graph theory concepts. The application provides an interactive interface for users to visualize and manipulate graphs, aiding in the understanding of graph theory principles.

**Features
Interactive Graph Visualization: Create and edit nodes and edges in a graphical interface.
Graph Algorithms: Implement and visualize various graph algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and more.
Customization Options: Customize the appearance of nodes and edges.
Save and Load Graphs: Save your graphs to a file and load them later for further analysis.
Educational Tools: Step-by-step execution of algorithms with visual representation to aid learning.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
**Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphematics.git
cd graphematics
Install dependencies (if any):

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Creating a Graph
Open the application.
Use the mouse to add nodes by clicking on the canvas.
Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node to another.
Adjust node positions by dragging them.
Running Algorithms
Select an algorithm from the algorithm menu.
Follow the prompts to execute the algorithm step-by-step.
Observe the visual representation of the algorithm's execution on the graph.
Customizing Nodes and Edges
Right-click on a node or edge to open the customization menu.
Adjust properties such as color, size, and labels.
Saving and Loading Graphs
Use the save button to save the current graph to a file.
Use the load button to open a previously saved graph.
