# Graphematics

Graphematics is a Python-based application developed using the Tkinter library. It serves as an educational tool for studying graph theory concepts. The application provides an interactive interface for users to visualize and manipulate graphs, aiding in the understanding of graph theory principles.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Create, edit, and delete nodes and edges in a graphical interface.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implement and visualize various graph algorithms such as BFS (DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and more coming soon).
- **Customization Options**: Customize the appearance of nodes and edges (Coming soon).
- **Save and Load Graphs**: Save your graphs to a file and load them later for further analysis.
- **Educational Tools**: Step-by-step execution of algorithms with visual representation to aid learning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PureZinc/Graphematics.git
    cd Graphematics
    ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

### Creating a Graph

1. Open the application.
2. Use the mouse to add nodes by clicking on the canvas.
3. Connect nodes by clicking and dragging from one node to another.
4. Adjust node positions by dragging them.

### Running Algorithms

1. Select an algorithm from the algorithm menu.
2. Follow the prompts to execute the algorithm step-by-step.
3. Observe the visual representation of the algorithm's execution on the graph.

### Customizing Nodes and Edges

1. Right-click on a node or edge to open the customization menu.
2. Adjust properties such as color, size, and labels.

### Saving and Loading Graphs

1. Use the save button to save the current graph to a file.
2. Use the load button to open a previously saved graph.
